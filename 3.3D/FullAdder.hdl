// Matthew Gray - 212417139, 3.1P - Implement the Full Adder in HDL
// This chip is the Full Adder, and is made from two half adders and an OR Gate
// The input is three bits, the output is a sum bit(LSB) and a carry bit(MSB).

CHIP FullAdder {
    IN a, b, c;
    OUT sum, carry;

    PARTS:
    HalfAdder(a=a, b=b, sum=x1, carry=c1);
    HalfAdder(a=x1, b=c, sum=sum, carry=c2);
    Or(a=c1, b=c2, out=carry);
}
